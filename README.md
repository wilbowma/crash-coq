Crash Verified Coq
==
Run `make`; if you have Coq and OCaml installed and in your path, this should
compile the verified Coq program, link it with a well-typed OCaml program, and
crash.

WARNING: this will jump to an arbitrary location in memory and hopefully
segfault, but I don't know your operating system so use at your own risk.
